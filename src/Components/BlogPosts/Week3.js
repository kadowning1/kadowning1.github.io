                         <p class="card-text">From my prior post, I looked up and down the aisles way too often this week.  It was quite the week overall.  
                         Lots of learning of <i>Dev Tools</i> and <i>JavaScript</i> while leaning back on initial concepts of <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i>. </p>

                        <p>Our task was to create an Alarm Clock application to Demo on Friday.  I thought I had a solid grasp of the concepts, 
                            but I showed myself I have much to learn.  I looked up and down and around to find why my application wasn't working.  
                            I <i>psuedocoded</i> as best as I could.  I tried to read as much as I could.  I put in the time, however, the application was holding me back 
                            for some reason.  Looking back, I think I spent too much time and needed to take a second to decompress after spending 
                            the time on the project.  Once I took this time to listen, study, and demo my project, it all came together.  
                            It showed me how difficult this Bootcamp will be, but also why it is going to be fun and worthwhile to solve problems while 
                            progressing each week.  
                            Again this week, I learned so much about my mistakes that will only make me better in the long run.</p>

                        <p>Next week is full-on <i>psuedocode</i>.  I think this week will be vital for me to help establish my thoughts before writing the code.  
                            If I have my thoughts in order, the code hopefully will follow!
                        </p>
