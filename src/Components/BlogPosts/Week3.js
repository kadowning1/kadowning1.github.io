                                    Week 6 of the Bootcamp is in the books. Our cohort had an up and down week with learning
                                    through the camp and dealing with the realities of 2021. We had a few days remote this week
                                    and ended the week back in person to demo our Weather projects. I learn so much by being in
                            person and one of the main reasons I decided to do this Web Dev class.</p>
                                <p>
                                    This week we learned how to fetch an API and return up-to-date information that we can use
                                    while creating different programs. API's open up so many possibilities for our current and
                                    future projects. It is still amazing how everyone in our class is writing code that differs
                                    and accomplishes the same result. You're able to tell how others in the Bootcamp develop
                                    good code by having it logical, clear, and understandable to the class. These are key traits
                            that I hope to include in each of my projects going forward.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Looking forward to this week, we are working on a Tic-Tac-Toe project that is sure to test
                                    our capabilities. I enjoy each week see what aspects of our prior projects I can use and
                                    help me brainstorm for current projects. It is always a test to fit the puzzle together, but
                                    knowing to do this one step at a time will be beneficial. I can't wait to continue to learn
                            and build on our concepts each day. </p>
                                <p>See you next week! </p>
