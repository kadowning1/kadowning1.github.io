                            instructed to use Local Storage to complete a Todo list assignment while using all of our new React documentation.  For me, this week was similar to weeks in the past.  
                            There were some points of the week 
                            I thought I would struggle to deliver the project in time, but I was able to meet all the requirements necessary during the demo. </p>

                            <p>I learned so much more about React this week and  I'm looking forward to gaining more knowledge into it.  
                                In general, I'm very organized, and React will help me work through this with projects by the lifecycle that is used with the framework.  
                                While it is assured to present more challenges, I'm accepting these challenges to learn and grow as much as possible from week to week.</p>

                            <p>For next week, we are working even more into React with our instructors 
                                introducing advanced topics.  With the way React has been presented to us thus far,  
                                I'm hopeful these topics will help with organization and efficiency while continuing to push me to add more knowledge every week.</p>
