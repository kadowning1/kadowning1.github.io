                        <p className="card-text">The second week of the remote onboarding is full of content! Introductions
                            to <i>HTML</i> , <i>CSS</i> , and <i>Google Dev Tools</i>  can be very overwhelming. I understand the main
                            concepts of each, but can't wait until they become repetitive and second nature. </p>
                        <p>Learning <i>Git</i>  has been a challenge even more so this week. I am understanding what commands
                            work, but getting frustrated when it is not seamless. </p>
                        <p>I know with this camp, I will continue to run into obstacles daily. With these daily
                            obstacles, I walk through whether to reach out for help or try to solve the issue myself. An
                            everyday comparison would be comparing this camp to a typical trip to Lowes. I understand
                            general concepts with what I am looking for, but often struggle to find them. At Lowes, I go
                            knowing what I am looking for and where it is. If I can't find it, I usually don't ask for
                            assistance until I have looked up and down aisles. Call it stubborn, determined, focused, or
                            ignorant, but I like solving problems. I hope to take these traits and use them for my
                            benefit in the weeks ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p>Looking forward, I am focusing even more so on <i>JavaScript</i>. I don't have all the pieces to
                            create an application yet, but I can see how what we are learning in this content-filled
                            week will translate when we add more programs. I'm excited that September is here and the
                            in-person portion of the Bootcamp is just around the corner. Let the fun and learning
                            continue!</p>
