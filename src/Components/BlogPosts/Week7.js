                            <p class="card-text">Our last Vanilla Javascript learning week is complete.  We had to create Tic-Tac-Toe using 
                            class structures and it was quite the learning curve.  Our instructors introduced the project earlier than usual so I knew it was going to be an uphill climb to 
                            deliver during the demo phase of our camp.  It was a week of ups and downs, but overall it was a week in which I feel like I grew and learned immeasurably. </p>

                            <p>The Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern introduced to us both helped and hurt me during this week.  
                                It helped me compartmentalize where certain aspects of the code needed to go, but overall it took a couple of days for me to wrap my head around the concept.  
                                Ultimately, it was repetition and hard work that helped me get through this week and have a working Tic-Tac-Toe game to show our cohort.</p>

                            <p>With this design pattern, it helped not only with actual code but also with the psuedocode.  
                                The psuedocode that is written will help structure the page and set your logic to when it is time to write code, you can walk through line by line to 
                                get the code to do what you want it to.  
                                I know this is not a strength of mine at the moment, but an opportunity to grow and continue learning through the camp.</p>
