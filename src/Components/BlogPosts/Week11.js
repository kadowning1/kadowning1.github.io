                            <p class="card-text">Week 11 of the Bootcamp presented the same challenges as the previous weeks.  This week, we learned about PHP and SQL for the first time, 
                            and with that came a few more highs and lows.  PHP is a completely new concept so it's amazing to see the similarities between it and Javascript.  The logic is the same, 
                            but the syntax is an adjustment.  
                            I caught on relatively quickly and I have begun to look forward to other languages and frameworks to learn to continue to grow.</p>

                            <p>Our project this week consisted of using PHP to alter data in a SQL table.  
                                It was very insightful to see how they are connected and how to run specific queries to get the information that is needed.  
                                Once I was able to get one query fully functional, the project came together quickly.  I'm excited to put all of our "pieces" together to create our final 
                                project at the end of Bootcamp.  
                                The camp is flying by while I'm also learning so much! </p>

                            <p>A challenge for me for the last few weeks of camp will be a mental hurdle.  I'm going to need to 
                                balance learning new concepts, with delivering the projects, while also thinking about obtaining a job once the Bootcamp is complete.  
                                I don't want to get ahead of myself, but also don't want to fall behind in anything.  It will take some focus and discipline, but I'm up for the challenge.</p>
