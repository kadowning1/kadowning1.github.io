                                bootcamp. I have been learning up to this point to seamlessly enter the bootcamp as prepared
                                as possible while also leaving myself opportunities to see how others can teach me certain
                                aspects. I'm trying to combine many avenues (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp, Eloquent <i>Javascript</i> and
                             Prework) to be in a position to approach the camp full steam ahead.</p>

                                <p>The first week has given me all the emotions that I've expected. Excitement, nervousness,
                                anxiousness, and a sense of purpose knowing I'm on the right track. I've enjoyed all of the
                                headaches and processes of the first week especially with <i>Git</i> and <i>GitHub</i>. I know it is
                                not going to be easy, but I can't wait to build on skills each day. I'm looking forward to
                                grasping <i>JavaScript</i> as well as continuing building on my introductory *Git* skills.
                                Additionally in talking to mentors in the field, I'm eager to learn more on the *SQL* and
                                Backend side of the entire stack. Let the fun begin!</p>
                                
                        <p> I will continue to add to this page frequently so be on the lookout for more content ahead!</p>
