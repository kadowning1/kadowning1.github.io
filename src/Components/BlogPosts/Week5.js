                            First week in person and what a difference it makes for me personally. The people I've met, the
                            concepts I've learned, the concepts I've built on, the sleep I have lacked has made it a fun
                            long week.</p>
                        <p>
                            It has been a week of ups and downs. One of my biggest hurdles is mentally preparing myself
                            for the lessons and projects. I've learning again "How to Learn" and enjoying the process.
                            So many new concepts this week with <i>Atomic Design</i> and <i>Bootstrap</i> to add to our projects.
                            Being able to stack each concept on top of previously learned concepts will be very key for
                            me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have been challenged this week personally to figure out our "Why". Luckily in this
                            regard, I'm crystal clear in my focus after bootcamp. I have checks in place to have
                            perspective with the difficult learning that is to come. This lifestyle will help me take
                            this journey one day at time to achieve my goals through this bootcamp.
