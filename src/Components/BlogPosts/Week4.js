                            close. It has been very helpful in many regards like allowing me to transition at a slower
                            pace. I've been able to get some footing before diving completely in. Also, it has helped
                            with the mental aspect of this camp for me by letting me deal with my frustrations and
                            figuring out the best way to overcome these hurdles. I have learned so much, but ready for
                            the in-person portion to start on Monday to be able to bounce ideas off fellow cohort
                            members and learn even more quickly with in-person instruction.</p>
                        <p>
                            In the past week, we have worked primarily on *psuedocode* and getting our thoughts in line.
                            The <i>psuedocode</i> projects had up and downs for me (Imagine that!). I enjoyed getting my
                            thoughts together, but I know I need to get them better organized and more clear to
                            translate that into actual code. I can see a great help this will be before actually writing
                            the code, so I want to make sure to prioritize this going forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming up, one thing is sure. I'm giving this camp all that I have. I have enjoyed being back
                            in a class and learning every day while still being at home. Being in an actual classroom
                            will be something to get used to again. I know it is only going to make me better in the
                            future. There will be several ups and downs throughout the Bootcamp, but by taking it day by
                            day I will certainly see the work pay off.</p>
