                            <p class="card-text">Week 6 of Front-End of the Bootcamp is complete.  I feel like this was a big week for me.  
                            Oftentimes throughout the Bootcamp, 
                            I felt like I have struggled to learn concepts and implement them.  
                            With this struggle, my confidence has been up and down each week.  </p>

                            <p>This week our instructors introduced React Hooks and the beginnings of the back-end process of web development.  
                                My project was to complete a user authentication app to grab data from an API and log in to the user successfully.  
                                I feel like I gravitated toward this project because it was very hands-on with data and adding it to my app.  
                                With the back-end learning starting in full force next week, I can't wait to use, store, and access data that the user is constantly providing.</p>

                            <p>At the end of this week, we have learned different aspects of React for the past three weeks.  From creating classes to functions to hooks to routing, 
                                I have learned so much about creating apps with React in such a short amount of time.  
                                With only six weeks left, the camp is flying by and our attention will now turn to 
                                managing the new concepts with trying to look forward to our job search at the end of camp.</p>
