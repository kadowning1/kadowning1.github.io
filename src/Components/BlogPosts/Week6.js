                            <p className="card-text">Week 2 of Front-end of the Bootcamp is in the books. Our cohort had an up and down week with learning through the 
                            camp and dealing with the realities of 2021.  We had a few days remote this week and ended the week 
                            back in person to demo our Weather projects.  
                            I learn so much by being in person and one of the main reasons I decided to do this Web Dev class.</p>

                            <p>This week we learned how to fetch an API and return up-to-date information that we can use while creating different programs.  
                                API's open up so many possibilities for our current and future projects.  It is still amazing how everyone in our class is writing code that 
                                differs and accomplishes the same result.  You're able to tell how others in the Bootcamp develop good code by having it logical, clear, and 
                                understandable to the class.  These are key traits that I hope to include in each of my projects going forward.</p>

                            <p>Looking forward to this week, we are working on a Tic-Tac-Toe project that is sure to test our capabilities.  I enjoy 
                                each week seeing what aspects of our prior projects I can use and help me brainstorm for current projects.  It is always 
                                a test to fit the puzzle together, but knowing to do this one 
                                step at a time will be beneficial.  I can't wait to continue to learn and build on our concepts each day.</p>
