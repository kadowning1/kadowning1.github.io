                            It's awesome to see the progress of me and all of my fellow cohort members throughout the process so far.  We have all had our ups and downs,
                            successes and struggles, and yet we all show up the next day/week to take on the next challenge. </p>

                            <p>The challenge this week was our intro to React.  There are so many valuable parts of React and I've barely scratched the surface of its capabilities.
                            I love the structure it provides on how to order the page creation.  I've struggled in the past with this concept with Vanilla Javascript, but
                            I think React will help solve this for me.
                                It helps me visualize what I need to do to get a functioning site up as well as add any enhancements.</p>

                            <p>One of my favorites parts of React is the Dev Tools in which I can utilize the components to store data.
                            I love being about to have data so readily available that I can put it to use. In the coming weeks,
                                I'm looking forward to seeing new ways to store and manipulate the data to get the result that I'm hoping to accomplish. </p>
