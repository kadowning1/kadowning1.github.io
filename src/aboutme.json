    "p2": "The first week has given me all the emotions that I've expected. Excitement, nervousness, anxiousness, and a sense of purpose knowing I'm on the right track. I've enjoyed all of the headaches and processes of the first week especially with Git and GitHub. I know it is not going to be easy, but I can't wait to build on skills each day. I'm looking forward to grasping JavaScript as well as continuing building on my introductory Git skills. Additionally in talking to mentors in the field, I'm eager to learn more on the SQL and Backend side of the entire stack. Let the fun begin!",
