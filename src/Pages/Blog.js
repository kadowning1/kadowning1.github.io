                                through the camp and dealing with the realities of 2021. We had a few days remote this week
                                and ended the week back in person to demo our Weather projects. I learn so much by being in

                                This week we learned how to fetch an API and return up-to-date information that we can use
                                while creating different programs. API's open up so many possibilities for our current and
                                future projects. It is still amazing how everyone in our class is writing code that differs
                                and accomplishes the same result. You're able to tell how others in the Bootcamp develop
                                good code by having it logical, clear, and understandable to the class. These are key traits
                            that I hope to include in each of my projects going forward.</p>

                                help me brainstorm for current projects. It is always a test to fit the puzzle together, but
                                knowing to do this one step at a time will be beneficial. I can't wait to continue to learn

                                Our last Vanilla Javascript learning week is complete. We had to create Tic-Tac-Toe using
                                class structures and it was quite the learning curve. Our instructors introduced the project
                                earlier than usual so I knew it was going to be an uphill climb to deliver during the demo
                                phase of our camp. It was a week of ups and downs, but overall it was a week in which I feel
                                like I grew and learned immeasureably.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                The Model, View, Controller (MVC) design pattern introduced to us both helped and hurt me
                                during this week. It helped me compartmentalize of where certain aspects of the code needed
                                to go, but overall it took a couple of days for me to wrap my head around the concept.
                                Ultimitely, it was repitition and hard work that helped me get through this week and having
                                a working Tic-Tac-Toe game to show our cohort.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                With this design pattern, it helped not only with actual code, but also with the psuedocode.
                                The psuedocode that is written will help structure the page and set your logic to when it is
                                time to write code, you can walk through line by line to get the code to do what you want it
                                to. I know this is not a strength of mine at the moment, but an opportunity to grow and
                                continue learnging through the camp.
                        </p>
                            <p>

                                First week in person. What a difference it makes for me personally. The people I've met, the
                                concepts I've learned, the concepts I've built on, the sleep I have lacked has made it a fun

                            <p>
                                It has been a week of ups and downs. One of my biggest hurdles is mentally preparing myself
                                for the lessons and projects. I've learning again "How to Learn" and enjoying the process.
                                So many new concepts this week with Atomic Design and Bootstrap to add to our projects.
                                Being able to stack each concept on top of previously learned concepts will be very key for
                                me.

                                We have been challenged this week personally to figure out our "Why". Luckily in this
                                regard, I'm crystal clear in my focus after bootcamp. I have checks in place to have
                                perspective with the difficult learning that is to come. This lifestyle will help me take
                                this journey one day at time to achieve my goals through this bootcamp.

                            close. It has been very helpful in many regards like allowing me to transition at a slower
                            pace. I've been able to get some footing before diving completely in. Also, it has helped
                            with the mental aspect of this camp for me by letting me deal with my frustrations and
                            figuring out the best way to overcome these hurdles. I have learned so much, but ready for
                            the in-person portion to start on Monday to be able to bounce ideas off fellow cohort
                            members and learn even more quickly with in-person instruction.</p>
                            <p>
                                In the past week, we have worked primarily on *psuedocode* and getting our thoughts in line.
                                The *psuedocode* projects had up and downs for me (Imagine that!). I enjoyed getting my
                                thoughts together, but I know I need to get them better organized and more clear to
                                translate that into actual code. I can see a great help this will be before actually writing
                                the code, so I want to make sure to prioritize this going forward.
                        </p>
                            <p>Coming up, one thing is sure. I'm giving this camp all that I have. I have enjoyed being back
                            in a class and learning every day while still being at home. Being in an actual classroom
                            will be something to get used to again. I know it is only going to make me better in the
                            future. There will be several ups and downs throughout the Bootcamp, but by taking it day by
                            day I will certainly see the work pay off.</p>

                            <p>I know with this camp, I will continue to run into obstacles daily. With these daily
                            obstacles, I walk through whether to reach out for help or try to solve the issue myself. An
                            everyday comparison would be comparing this camp to a typical trip to Lowes. I understand
                            general concepts with what I am looking for, but often struggle to find them. At Lowes, I go
                            knowing what I am looking for and where it is. If I can't find it, I usually don't ask for
                            assistance until I have looked up and down aisles. Call it stubborn, determined, focused, or
                            ignorant, but I like solving problems. I hope to take these traits and use them for my
                            benefit in the weeks ahead.
                        </p>
                            <p>Looking forward, I am focusing even more so on *JavaScript*. I don't have all the pieces to
                            create an application yet, but I can see how what we are learning in this content-filled
                            week will translate when we add more programs. I'm excited that September is here and the
                            in-person portion of the Bootcamp is just around the corner. Let the fun and learning
                            continue!</p>

                            bootcamp. I have been learning up to this point to seamlessly enter the bootcamp as prepared
                            as possible while also leaving myself opportunities to see how others can teach me certain
                            aspects. I'm trying to combine many avenues (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp, Eloquent *Javascript*
                            and Prework) to be in a position to approach the camp full steam ahead.</p>

                            <p>The first week has given me all the emotions that I've expected. Excitement, nervousness,
                            anxiousness, and a sense of purpose knowing I'm on the right track. I've enjoyed all of the
                            headaches and processes of the first week especially with *Git* and *GitHub*. I know it is
                            not going to be easy, but I can't wait to build on skills each day. I'm looking forward to
                            grasping *JavaScript* as well as continuing building on my introductory *Git* skills.
                            Additionally in talking to mentors in the field, I'm eager to learn more on the *SQL* and
                            Backend side of the entire stack. Let the fun begin!
                        <p> I will continue to add to this page frequently so be on the lookout for more content ahead!
