# KD's Web Developmental Dive

Welcome to my programming journey!  This site will always be a work in progress with blogs and projects.  I'm excited to start a web development bootcamp to enhance my skills and become a Dev!  I know it will be a journey of headache, lack of sleep, and pressure, but eager to build each and every day.

## Blog Posts

### First Week of Onboarding

>Creating my first blog post during the onboarding stages of the Web Dev bootcamp. I have been learning up to this point to seamlessly enter the bootcamp as prepared as possible while also leaving myself opportunities to see how others can teach me certain aspects. I'm trying to combine many avenues (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp, Eloquent *Javascript* & Prework) to be in a position to approach the camp full steam ahead.

>The first week has given me all the emotions that I've expected.  Excitement, nervousness, anxiousness, and a sense of purpose knowing I'm on the right track.  I've enjoyed all of the headaches and processes of the first week especially with *Git* and *GitHub*.  I know it is not going to be easy, but I can't wait to build on skills each day.  I'm looking forward to grasping *JavaScript* as well as continuing building on my introductory *Git* skills.  Additionally in talking to mentors in the field, I'm eager to learn more on the *SQL* & Backend side of the entire stack.  Let the fun begin!

 ### Activities outside of Bootcamp I enjoy:

>I will continue to add to this page frequently so be on the lookout for more content ahead!

>See you next week!

### Second Week of Onboarding

>The second week of the remote onboarding is full of content!  Introductions to *HTML*, *CSS*, & *Google Dev Tools* can be very overwhelming.  I understand the main concepts of each, but can't wait until they become repetitive and second nature.

>Learning *Git* has been a challenge even more so this week.  I am understanding what commands work, but getting frustrated when it is not seamless. 

>I know with this camp, I will continue to run into obstacles daily.  With these daily obstacles, I walk through whether to reach out for help or try to solve the issue myself.  An everyday comparison would be comparing this camp to a typical trip to Lowes.  I understand general concepts with what I am looking for, but often struggle to find them.  At Lowes, I go knowing what I am looking for and where it is.  If I can't find it, I usually don't ask for assistance until I have looked up and down aisles.  Call it stubborn, determined, focused, or ignorant, but I like solving problems.  I hope to take these traits and use them for my benefit in the weeks ahead.

>Going forward, I am focusing even more so on *JavaScript*.  I don't have all the pieces to create an application yet, but I can see how what we are learning in this content-filled week will translate when we add more programs. I'm excited that September is here and the in-person portion of the Bootcamp is just around the corner.  Let the fun and learning continue!
### Past week in my personal life:

>> My son, Wyatt, turned 1 and we had a birthday party for him with friends and family.

>I can already tell this blog will be helpful on so many levels.  It will allow me to always reflect on the past while looking toward the future.

>See you next week!

### Third Week of Onboarding

>>From my prior post, I looked up and down the aisles way too often this week.  It was quite the week overall.  Lots of learning of *Dev Tools* and *JavaScript* while leaning back on initial concepts of *HTML* and *CSS*.

>>Our task was to create an Alarm Clock application to Demo on Friday.  I thought I had a solid grasp of the concepts, but I showed myself I have much to learn.  I looked up and down and even around to find why my application wasn't working.  I *psuedocoded* as best as I could.  I tried to read as much as I could.  I put in the time, however, the application was holding me back for some reason.  Looking back, I think I spent too much time and needed to take a second to decompress after spending the time on the project.  Once I took this time to listen, study, and demo my project, it all came together.  It showed me how difficult this Bootcamp will be, but also why it is going to be fun and worthwhile to solve problems while progressing each week.  Again this week, I learned so much about my mistakes that will only make me better in the long run.

>>Next week is full-on *psuedocode*.  I think this week will be vital for me to help establish my thoughts before writing the code.  If I have my thoughts in order, the code hopefully will follow!

>>See you next week!

 ### Fourth Week of Onboarding

>>It's hard to believe, but the remote portion of the Bootcamp has come to a close.  It has been very helpful in many regards like allowing me to transition at a slower pace.  I've been able to get some footing before diving completely in.  Also, it has helped with the mental aspect of this camp for me by letting me deal with my frustrations and figuring out the best way to overcome these hurdles.  I have learned so much, but ready for the in-person portion to start on Monday to be able to bounce ideas off fellow cohort members and learn even more quickly with in-person instruction.

>>In the past week, we have worked primarily on *psuedocode* and getting our thoughts in line.  The *psuedocode* projects had up and downs for me (Imagine that!).  I enjoyed getting my thoughts together, but I know I need to get them better organized and more clear to translate that into actual code.   I can see a great help this will be before actually writing the code, so I want to make sure to prioritize this going forward.

>>Coming up, one thing is sure.  I'm giving this camp all that I have.  I have enjoyed being back in a class and learning every day while still being at home.  Being in an actual classroom will be something to get used to again.  I know it is only going to make me better in the future. There will be several ups and downs throughout the Bootcamp, but by taking it day by day I will certainly see the work pay off.

>>See you next week!
