# KD's Web Developmental Dive

Welcome to my programming journey!  This site will always be a work in progress with blogs and projects.  I'm excited to start a web development bootcamp to enhance my skills and become a Dev!  I know it will be a journey of headache, lack of sleep, and pressure, but eager to build each and every day.

### First Week of Onboarding

>Creating my first blog post during the onboarding stages of the Web Dev bootcamp. I have been learning up to this point to seamlessly enter the bootcamp as prepared as possible while also leaving myself opportunities to see how others can teach me certain aspects. I'm trying to combine many avenues (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp, Eloquent *Javascript* & Prework) to be in a position to approach the camp full steam ahead.

>The first week has given me all the emotions that I've expected.  Excitement, nervousness, anxiousness, and a sense of purpose knowing I'm on the right track.  I've enjoyed all of the headaches and processes of the first week.  I know it is not going to be easy, but I can't wait to build on skills each day.  I'm looking forward to grasping *JavaScript* as well as how I can use it effectively in all of my projects going forward.  Additionally in talking to mentors in the field, I'm eager to learn more on the *SQL* & Backend side of the entire stack.  Let the fun begin!
